write a headless browser script to open https://gamio.greythr.com/ 
and enter username and password
and click 'Log in' button
and then when dashboard gets loaded completely
click on 'Sign In' button

add a condition into this script based on cmd line input
input can be 'signin' or 'signout'
modify the 'click on sign in button' step according to this input

read username and passowrd from shell env
username from GAMIO_GREYTHR_UNAME
passowrd from GAMIO_GREYTHR_PASS

create a readme markdown file for all instructions telling to save env in shell permanently, and how to execute the project etc.
I want whole readme file in one code block with markdown syntax

create a package.json file for this

Write UT for this

modify source code until it passes all UT, show the coverage percent

update the package json for new dependencies and script commands

can you write .gitignore for this project

what will be the file structure for this project?

what will be sample .env

convert all code files and readme files as this project will work in typescript
also the UT

what's new file structure?

```
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── gamio-greythr.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── test/
│   └── gamio-greythr.spec.ts
├── .dockerignore
├── .env.sample
├── .gitignore
├── Dockerfile
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json
```

can we use ts-node instead of tsc and node?

update the readme.md file accordingly for ts-node
I need this in markdown syntax inside code block

can you share final contents of all 10 files as listed in file structure
