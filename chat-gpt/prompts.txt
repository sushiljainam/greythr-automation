write a headless browser script to open https://gamio.greythr.com/ 
and enter username and password
and click 'Log in' button
and then when dashboard gets loaded completely
click on 'Sign In' button

add a condition into this script based on cmd line input
input can be 'signin' or 'signout'
modify the 'click on sign in button' step according to this input

read username and passowrd from shell env
username from GAMIO_GREYTHR_UNAME
passowrd from GAMIO_GREYTHR_PASS

create a readme markdown file for all instructions telling to save env in shell permanently, and how to execute the project etc.
I want whole readme file in one code block with markdown syntax
